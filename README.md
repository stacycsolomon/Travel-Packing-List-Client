### A Trip Planner App

This application was designed for the frequent flyer, to allow travelers to stay organized for upcoming travel. Users are able to create an account, and have a central location that they can use to keep track of upcoming trips. A user will be able to show all trips, add new trips, update or delete existing trips.

You can find the deployed application [here](https://stacycsolomon.github.io/Travel-Packing-List-Client/)

### Images 

Below I have created the wireframe for this application. So far, the application is in its initial state, i.e, version 1. Travelers can add a new destination, include travel dates and the length of their stay. Version 2 will include a travel packing list broken down by item, quantity and description. The final version of the application will allow users to leave a trip review or comments about their trip.
